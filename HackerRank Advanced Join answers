1, Placements

select s.Name
from Students s
join Friends f on s.id = f.id
join Packages p1 on p1.id=f.id
join Packages p2 on p2.id=f.Friend_id
where p2.Salary > p1.salary
order by p2.salary

/*
1, connect the srtudents and friends table using their id
2, find the salary of the student using student id
3, find the salary of the student's friend using friend id
4, compare the salary
5, order as required
*/




2, Symmetric Pairs

select p1.x, p1.y from Functions p1, Functions p2
where p1.x =p2.y and p1.y = p2.x and p1.x<p1.y

union all

select p1.x, p1.y from Functions p1 
where p1.x=p1.y group by p1.x,p1.y
having count(*) >1
order by x asc

/*
the first section: find symmertic paris by using self-join and compare the value between x1 and y2, x2 and y1.
p1.x<p1.y is important because we have choosen the 2 symmertric pairs. so this code here will make sure it only return 1 pair
(p1.x<p2.x is also fine)

the second section will make sure to return those symmertric pairs that are the same numbers, like 20,20 and 20,20

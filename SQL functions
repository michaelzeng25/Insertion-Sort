To sum values that belong to the same category, and start from a certain value if the category changed.
example:
id  total category   target
1     10      a         10
1     11      a         21
2     20      b         20
2     22      b         42
set @sumit:=0;
set @id:='';
select t.*, @sumit:=if(@id = t.id, @sumit + t.total, t.total) as Cum_sum_score, @id:=t.id as id-copy
from table t

problem: have to also select this one, "@id:=t.id as id-copy", or it wont work
-- maybe put where @id:=t.id. 10/23/17

pick a certain vlaue if it is belong to the same category
example:
name     category    position
apple     fruit        5
apple      red         3
melon      big       null

to 

name     category    position
apple      red         3
melon      big        null

select t.*
from t
where coalesce(t.position, -1) = (select min(coalesce(t2.position, -1))from t t2 where t2.name = t.name);

First, is 5=3? no, is 3=3? yes, then print the first line - apple      red         3
then, is -1 =-1? yes then print the second line  melon      big        null ; 
(does not matter -1 or other numbers, it just look for a match if both are null from the table)

problem:if i have 2 rows of apple      red        3

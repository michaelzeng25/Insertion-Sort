say

id    name     score
1   michael     2
1   wendy      3
2     jack      4

to have the result
id    name     score
1   michael     2
1   wendy       5
2     jack      4

id 1 has its score added up


select t.*, @sumit:=if(@id = t.id, @sumit + t.score, t.score) as Cum_sum_score, @id:=t.id as id-copy
from table t
join (select @sumit:=0, @id:='')b


problem: have to also select this one, "@id:=t.id as id-copy", or it wont work

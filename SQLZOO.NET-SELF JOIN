1 TO 3 ARE VERY EASY

4, 
SELECT company, num, COUNT(*)
FROM route WHERE stop=149 OR stop=53
GROUP BY company, num
HAVING COUNT(*)>1;


5,
SELECT a.company, a.num, a.stop, b.stop
FROM route a JOIN route b 
ON (a.company=b.company AND a.num=b.num)
WHERE a.stop=53 and b.stop=149;

For company and num, using either a or b or mixed does not matter. 
this looks like the constructor overloading in programming



6,
SELECT a.company, a.num, stopa.name, stopb.name
FROM route a 
JOIN route b ON (a.company=b.company AND a.num=b.num)
JOIN stops stopa ON (a.stop=stopa.id)
JOIN stops stopb ON (b.stop=stopb.id)
WHERE stopa.name='Craiglockhart'AND stopb.name='London Road';

triple join. a.stop=stopa.id means to match the id on the two tables where id and stop contains the same numbers.
